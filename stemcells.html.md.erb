#### <a id="621-109"></a> 621.109

<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: March 05, 2021

#### Fixes Issues:<br>
<br>
GCP rsyslog behavior is fixed - cf ssh and rsyslog should be working as expected<br>
<br>
#### Important Notice:<br>
<br>
As of this release, on all IAASs, rsyslog will not start until `/var/log` is mounted. When used with a Bosh Agent, `/var/log` will automatically be mounted, and no further action is required.<br>
<br>
If you use this stemcell without a Bosh Agent and do not mount `/var/log`, then you need to do one of these two actions:<br>
<br>
* Remove the `ExecStartPre=` line from `/etc/systemd/system/rsyslog.service`<br>
* Blank out the contents of `/usr/local/bin/wait_for_var_log_to_be_mounted`<br>
<br>
Either action will cause rsyslog to no longer wait for `/var/log` to be mounted before starting.<br>

<br>
This version of the stemcell has the following issues when used on GCP:<br>
* Attempts to use `cf ssh` timeout. <br>
* The `iptables-logger` job fails to deploy<br>
<br>
This is because rsyslog is started before `/var/log` is mounted. This causes it to log to the root filesystem rather than the mounted persistent disk.<br>

**Release Date**: March 05, 2021

#### Fixes Issues:<br>
<br>
GCP rsyslog behavior is fixed - cf ssh and rsyslog should be working as expected<br>
<br>
#### Important Notice:<br>
<br>
As of this release, on all IAASs, rsyslog will not start until `/var/log` is mounted. When used with a Bosh Agent, `/var/log` will automatically be mounted, and no further action is required.<br>
<br>
If you use this stemcell without a Bosh Agent and do not mount `/var/log`, then you need to do one of these two actions:<br>
<br>
* Remove the `ExecStartPre=` line from `/etc/systemd/system/rsyslog.service`<br>
* Blank out the contents of `/usr/local/bin/wait_for_var_log_to_be_mounted`<br>
<br>
Either action will cause rsyslog to no longer wait for `/var/log` to be mounted before starting.<br>

#### <a id="456-145"></a> 456.145

<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: March 01, 2021

**Known Issues**: <br>
<br>
This version of the stemcell has the following issues when used on GCP:<br>
* Attempts to use `cf ssh` timeout. <br>
* The `iptables-logger` job fails to deploy<br>
<br>
This is because rsyslog is started before `/var/log` is mounted. This causes it to log to the root filesystem rather than the mounted persistent disk.<br>
<br>
This issue is fixed in stemcell version 456.146.<br>
